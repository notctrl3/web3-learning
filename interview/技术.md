投票批准。

DAOs are characterized by decentralization, autonomy and transparency. Decentralization means that there is no centralized management and all decisions are voted by community 
members. Autonomy means that the operating rules and decision-making processes are pre-set by smart contracts and executed automatically. Transparency means that all transactions and 
decisions are recorded on the blockchain and are open and transparent. 
DAO operates in a way that the rules and decisions of DAO are defined and executed by smart contracts. Members gain voting rights by holding tokens. Members make proposals and 
vote on them, and the smart contract automatically executes the passed proposals. The DAO's pool of funds is managed by the smart contract, and its use needs to be approved by members' 
votes. 
DAO is used in investment funds, decentralized finance (DeFi), community governance and public resource management. The advantages are transparency, participation and efficiency. 
Transparency is the openness of decision-making and financial flows. Participation is the extensive involvement of members in proposing and voting. Efficiency is automated decision 
making. Challenges are insufficient security, risk of smart contract vulnerabilities, and unclear legal status, making effective management and decision-making challenging. 
DAO achieves self-governance through decentralization, is transparent, efficient and participatory, and is widely used in areas such as investment, DeFi and community governance.

transaction privacy. 
3.The principle of privacy smart contracts is to use encryption technology to hide the content of the contract and participant information, applied to Enigma, Secret Network. 
4.The principle of Mixing Services is to mix multiple transactions, blurring the origin and destination of transactions. Used in Wasabi Wallet, CoinJoin.
